# Worker Distribution Complete ✅

## Summary

I've successfully distributed workers across all farms and created team allocations for various tasks.

## Worker Distribution

Workers are now evenly distributed across all 8 farms:

| Farm Name | Workers | Employee Numbers |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| Coastal Berry Farm | 5 | EMP0001, EMP0009, EMP0017, EMP0025, EMP0033 |
| Highlands Apple Farm | 5 | EMP0002, EMP0010, EMP0018, EMP0026, EMP0034 |
| Mountain View Estate | 5 | EMP0003, EMP0011, EMP0019, EMP0027, EMP0035 |
| Quinn Farms | 4 | EMP0004, EMP0012, EMP0020, EMP0028 |
| Riverbend Mixed Farm | 4 | EMP0005, EMP0013, EMP0021, EMP0029 |
| Sunrise Citrus Estate | 4 | EMP0006, EMP0014, EMP0022, EMP0030 |
| Valley Orchards | 4 | EMP0007, EMP0015, EMP0023, EMP0031 |
| Valley View Orchard | 4 | EMP0008, EMP0016, EMP0024, EMP0032 |

**Total: 35 workers distributed across 8 farms**

## Team Allocations

Workers have been assigned to different task teams. Each farm now has workers allocated across 6 task types:

- **Pruning Team** - Tree and vine pruning tasks
- **Mowing Team** - Grass and vegetation maintenance
- **Weeding Team** - Weed removal and control
- **Harvesting Team** - Fruit picking and collection
- **Spraying Team** - Chemical application
- **General Team** - General farm tasks

Allocations have been created for today's date with:
- Status: `completed`
- Hours: 8.0 hours
- Time: 07:00 - 16:00
- Block assignments: Workers assigned to blocks where available

## How to Verify

1. **Refresh your browser** (hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Navigate to Labour module**
3. **Select different farms** from the farm filter
4. **Filter by task type** (pruning, mowing, weeding, etc.)
5. You should see workers distributed across all farms and teams

## Next Steps

- The Quick Actions cards in the Labour module should now show counts for each team
- Summary statistics should reflect workers across all farms
- You can filter by farm and task type to see different teams
